These online communities are helpful platforms for non-professional medical opinions, yet pose risk of being unreliable in quality and insufficient in quantity to cover the wide range of potential drug reactions. Current approaches to analysing such user-generated content in online forums heavily rely on feature engineering of both documents and users, and often overlook the relationships between posts within a common discussion thread. Inspired by recent advancements, we propose a neural architecture that models the textual content of user-generated documents and user experiences in online communities to predict side effects during treatment. Experimental results show that our proposed architecture outperforms baseline models.",
