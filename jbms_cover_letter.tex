\opening{Dear Special Issue Editors,}

We would like to thank the reviewers for their careful assessment of the work and their consideration to publish our work. We are pleased to react to the comments that have been raised. We now thus briefly recap the major issues raised by the reviewers and our edits, accordingly. Other minor and typographical errors have been handled.

Firstly, we clarified our contributions by proposing NEAT, as asked by Reviewer~3 in Comment~1. In our first contribution in the Background section, we state that NEAT is a neural architecture that captures user expertise and credibility, the semantic content of individual posts and the holistic thread to improve side effect discovery from online health discussions. Its major principle of user credibility and experience assessment can be easily adopted by various neural attentional encoders.

Secondly, we have elaborated our argument on how neural approaches can model lexical variations of works by capturing their semantics, as raised by Reviewer~3 in Comment~2. Specifically, in the Related Work section, under Drug Side Effect Discovery, we argued that distributed  word  representations constructed from  context  can  capture semantics  based  on  the  hypothesis  that  synonyms  often  share  similar  contextual words. For example, ``headache'' and ``cephalea'' will have close representations if they share contextual words such as ``head'' or ``pain''. Approaches to sub-word embedding model the morphology of words by leveraging sub-word or character information. These representations are naturally integrated into neural sequential models that are sensitive to syntactic order.

Finally, we have incorporated the limitation of Mayo Clinic database reliability, especially in generalizing the work to general Medical informatics, as raised by Reviewer~3 in Comment~4. We suggest to have these annotations cross-checked with healthcare professionals or pharmacovigilance experts, in order to ensure the correlation between Mayo Clinic's annotations and the post's actually described side effects.

\closing{Sincerely,}
